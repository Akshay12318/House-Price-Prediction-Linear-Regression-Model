# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a **Machine Learning model** built with **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on features such as income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population.  

The repository includes:
- Jupyter notebooks for **EDA, model training, and evaluation**.
- A **saved model (.pkl)** file for reuse.
- A **Python script** for making predictions with custom input values.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (not included in repo) contains housing-related features:
- **Income**
- **House Age**
- **Number of Rooms**
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Population**
- **House Price (Target variable)**

## 📦 Requirements :
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib

Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open and execute the notebook to see:
- numpy
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training & evaluation

# Input 
income = 44000
house_age = 5
rooms = 3
bedrooms = 4
population = 50000

# Example output
You can sell your house at $269559

**Results**-
Model trained using Linear Regression from scikit-learn.
Predictions are based on provided housing features.
The model achieves a reasonable approximation of house prices.
